*Will-o'-the-wisp*

    In folklore, a will-o'-the-wisp, will-o'-wisp, or ignis fatuus (*Latin for 'foolish flame'; pl. ignes fatui*), is an atmospheric ghost light seen by travelers at night, especially over bogs, swamps or marshes. The phenomenon is known in much of European folklore by a variety of names, including jack-o'-lantern, friar's lantern, and hinkypunk, and is said to mislead travelers by resembling a flickering lamp or lantern.
