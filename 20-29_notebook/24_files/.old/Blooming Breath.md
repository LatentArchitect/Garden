# Blooming Breath

Cycles, like the one kingdom of legend,
rise and fall.
Like royalty 
we two have come to see
the lapse of these
marking nearly
three.

I thought, so long ago,
I would show you the world.
All four corners, I thought...
I believed I could know,
selfishly,
that our borders would grow endlessly.
We were going to hold the five kingdoms,
Kings and queens
laying beneath our esteemed wrath.

I believed this, then.
At present, though,
I have seen
the paint peel 
on those towering  walls.
Six ticks 
in a pattern of fire
and death,
show that the complexity
i once sought,
is empty,
like the kings and queens themselves.

Seven hells rage quietly,
in finite monotony.
What I see now?
You. 
Us.

We hold the value,
wrought by nothing.

Zero's succession.

Approaching eight
chapters of time,
I find
that what used to be?
It holds no substance.
Desaturated and weightless
when compared to 
this
immense,
simple infinity
between us.

"LOVE"

What it means and who you are to me are on in the same.
An entity, constructed of instinctual reverence and devotion, which exists beyond the shallow waters of what this world has to offer.

Our simple infinity.

I love you.

I know I constantly ramble about philosophy and why I think it is important. I know it can get irritating, especially when I randomly decide to make a small joke conversation into a huge debate, and I am so grateful that you are as patient as you are with me.

Love,

This time, though, fuck theory. Fuck what is and isn't cliche. I love you, and here is another long-winded reason why...

There is so little that I can do to show you how grateful I am for your love. Even just the patience you have is brighter and louder than I could possibly have hoped anyone would ever show me in my lifetime. But the acceptance, the depth of your compassion and love, are something I still struggle to accept one single person could ever hold within themselves.

Whether it be chaos, determinism, god, or destiny.
All of the best parts of who I am, I owe to you, and whatever function of reality allowed me to find you.

Over the last three years we have worked so hard, on ourselves and on each other. Its been complex, messy, and scary in a lot of ways. But it has also been the happiest and most rewarding time in my life. Sometimes it's hard to hold everything down in the right perspective, but the actuality that remains when I refocus the lense... I am unfathomably lucky.

I am lucky to have met you.
I am lucky to have you still.
I am lucky that we are where we are in life.
I am lucky to have become who I am.
I am lucky.

I just wanted you to know all that and to know that I still see it to this day.

Thank you for loving me. Thank you for being here and being who you are. I am so lucky and proud to be with you.
