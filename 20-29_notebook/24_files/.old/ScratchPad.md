Hello, I’m LatentArchitect (or Tristan), I am an artist/designer guy, i have such a long list of interests I won’t even begin to try lol. Just assume I wanna know more about it :slight_smile:

Actually pretty stoked to have found this forum. I haven’t checked it out almost at all quite yet. But, I can tell that I will love reading through stuff that would be likely to end up here

So... Hello *again, lol*

I am an artist/designer person. Mostly, I've been working on graphic design and web-design stuff recently. My "background" <small>*-if you could even call it that-*</small> is originally in traditional fine arts and illustration, though.

My 9 to 5 is in I.T. at the moment, but I am hoping to finally start making a living doing something *creative* within the next 6-12 months... hopefully. For the majority of the last two years I have been working fulltime at my normal job, while working art and design projects at night and on weekends. The majority of the stuff I have done recently has been for a studio my friends and I are starting called Latent Arcana Games. 

<!-- *I know... Ironic name, at the moment, considering we haven't actually completed a video game yet... But, we're working on it lol* -->

I have an extremely long list of interests, so I won’t even begin to try with listing them all. Just assume, if it involves any kind of creativity, deep thought, or originality, I am *very* interested in knowing more about it.

I am not usually very active on the internet most of the time, contrary to the usual tendencies of my generation, so it may be a bit of a learning curve for me in becoming comfortable here in this community. I am extremely excited and interested, though, so I hope I don't give off too rough an impression.

You all seem extremely talented and intelligent, and I am very excited to learn both from and about everyone here.
