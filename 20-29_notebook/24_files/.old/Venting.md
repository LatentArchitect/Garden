    Wanted to comment:

    > Couple of comments
    > - First set = bad parents, sucks that people like that exist with children for sure
    > - Second woman = mentally ill, most likely, as she would have been tested for hallucinogenics and gone to jail instead of a mental health facility
    > - Third Woman = bad, but none of that looked like aggravated assault from what i can saw (though obviously the whole incident wasn't shown in clips)
