Hello, I have seen that the new Readwise Reader is in beta. It is only include in the full price subscription of 8$ a month, right? Why Reader over Instapaper? Instapaper is free with a few restrictions you can live without?

Exporting notes from Readwise: I have come across readwise and the exporting thingy through ali abdaal&#39;s video: &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;lhpY1frNqdA&gt;

This exporting feature is again only available with the full price subscription, right? If so, can anyone recommend other apps for collecting your notes and highlights and exporting them into in my case RemNote? The alternative for the reader would just be instapaper or pocket.

Thanks very much in advance!
