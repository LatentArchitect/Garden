It's an AI collaborator, grounded in your data with your unique view of the world. \n\nIn this tutorial, I'll give you a tour of the main functionalities, demonstrate concrete use cases such as making sense of meeting notes or writing an article, and cover the current limitations. \n\nVisit https://ift.tt/L8PHQhC to sign up for a free NotebookLM account using your Google login (You must be at least 18 years of age, based in the U.S., and Workspace users must have ‚ÄúExperimental apps enabled‚Äù by an administrator)\n\nüòé Get 60 days of Readwise for free: https://ift.tt/eO5EKT4\nüìñ Watch my full Readwise tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlWomVta4DU \n\nTECHNICAL NOTES\n[08:37]: NotebookLM isn‚Äôt actually ‚Äútrained‚Äù on your data. The model is pre-trained, and the software just shuttles your inputs into its context window temporarily so it can answer factually based on that information. Once you end your session, the information you entered is wiped from the model's memory so your data is secure.\n\n[13:30]: NotebookLM can answer specific questions, but holistic questions (such as \"Give me an outline of the entire book, in order\") are harder, because the model can‚Äôt take in the entire document at once; it can only see the most relevant passages for a given query. \n\nCHAPTERS\n00:00 - 01:20 Intro\n01:21 - 09:04 Getting started\n09:06 - 14:52 Use cases for understanding \n14:53 - 21:12 Use cases for writing\n21:13 - 23:12 Using Readwise with NotebookLM \n23:13 - 24:23 Limitations\n24:24 - 25:23 Conclusion\n25:24 - 25:47 Blooper\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nBuilding a Second Brain is the proven method to organize your digital life and unlock your creative potential. \n\nWe're on a mission to help you¬†increase your productivity, and ‚Äã‚Äãlead a more fulfilling life with more ease and less stress. \n\nü§ì  TEST YOUR PRODUCTIVITY POTENTIAL\nIf you had a Second Brain, how much more organized, effective, calm, and creative could you be?¬†\nTake our quiz & find out: https://ift.tt/KCzJy1c\n\nüß†  HOW YOU CAN BUILD YOUR SECOND BRAIN\nOrder the book: https://ift.tt/zxDZMfN\nTake the course: https://ift.tt/GgI8o6u\n\nüì¨  JOIN THE FORTE LABS NEWSLETTER\nLevel up your productivity and life with new essays, videos, event invites, and other resources every Tuesday.

    "": "Track 1 \"Pregaming The Rapture\" by Groundislava from the 'S/T' LP (2011).\n\nPurchase: https://ift.tt/VjMaUPm\n\nFor Jasper Patterson AKA Groundislava, creativity combined with the video game, sci-fi sounds and general aesthetics of the 1980's have been instilled since day one. A young 20 year-old hailing from Venice, California, Jasper's father both animated and directed the classic \"Take On Me\" video by A-Ha and while Groundislava isn't exactly the next logical step from the Norwegian new wave group, Jasper takes that same creative freedom and emotion and injects it into a sound grounded in beats, video games, technology and self-proclaimed \"nerdy shit.\" As part of the Wedidit Collective (helmed by his old schoolmate Henry Laufer, better known as Shlohmo), Groundislava is the next representative stepping into the light and exposing a group of youngsters each with their own nonchalantly expert takes on forms of beat and electronic music. \n\nWhile deeply infatuated with the styles of house music and minimal techno (check \"The Dig\" or \"Stealth River Mission\"), on his debut self-titled LP, Groundislava takes old templates of 8 bit and chip-tune styles and turns them into worlds full of oozing, swirling melodies backed by driving drum beats, heavy bass drops and soaring vocal melodies in spots from vocalist Weary. Alongside the crop of up and coming worldwide electronic producers such as Shlohmo, Young Montana? and another former classmate Baths, Patterson is primed and ready to unleash his unique brand of woozy 8-bit composition. Whereas much music that utilizes the 8 bit sound tends to feel fully mechanized and soulless, GIL injects heartfelt harmonies and melodies that demand attention - \"Final Impasse\" and \"One For Her\" will surely make you stop in your tracks and listen up. Elsewhere, Wedidit cohorts Jon Wayne and Shlohmo stop by for the track \"Shlava,\" with Wayne delivering super on point and off the cuff raps on top of Jasper's laid-back video game beat vibes. Another early favorite is the sinister and downtempo \"Animal,\" featuring Weary's dark and twisted croons. \n\nAfter a well-received free EP giveaway in early '11, Groundislava's self-titled debut LP + 7\" is scheduled for release on 4/19 through the Friends of Friends Music label. Included with the 12 song long-player are remixes from Young Montana? and Clive Tanaka.\n\nFollow Groundislava:\nFacebook: https://ift.tt/u6jpIre\nInstagram: https://ift.tt/6Q21ecX\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/groundislava\nBandcamp: https://ift.tt/Y10UPdZ\nSoundcloud: https://ift.tt/0zFALaY\nSpotify: https://ift.tt/3o7MJYA\n\nFollow Friends Of Friends:\nFacebook: https://ift.tt/rubnEfF\nInstagram: https://ift.tt/MDNVX2P\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoFMusic\nBandcamp: https://ift.tt/cT6FQqv\nDeezer: https://ift.tt/eLxKsHm\nSoundcloud: https://ift.tt/C2pf1Ot\nSpotify: https://ift.tt/iX5qoFn\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/user/FoFMusicVideos\nWebsite: https://ift.tt/eBE0jCG\n\n#groundislava #friendsoffriends #fofmusic",

What I was trying to figure out was if Mirabella was an \"absolute monarchy,\" as in the monarch is the sole legislative power in the nation. In the case of something like the United Kingdom, that is a constitutional monarchy where the monarch has very little, to almost zero power in the actual workings of the government. There are 7 countries in the world today with absolute monarchies, and one of them funnily enough is The Vatican. \n\n\"I cannot believe that he rated _____ so low\" \n\nI would not take my actual numbered ratings too seriously, as they can seriously be crippled by both the moral and sidekick ratings - which, honestly, are totally ridiculous categories to judge the movies and half the time I gave a zero if they didn't have them. If you are a Barbie fanatic, and genuinely liked a movie that I rated low, I'd suggest taking my \"Barbie\" and \"Story\" ratings, and then make that number out of 10. That's probably a more \"real\" rating for the Barbie movie. \n\nCHAPTERS: \n0:00 - Intro\n0:57 - The Plan\n2:53 - Barbie in the Nutcracker (2001)\n4:42 - Barbie as Rapunzel (2002)\n5:41 - Barbie of Swan Lake (2003)\n6:44 - Barbie as the Princess & The Pauper (2004)\n8:13 - Lore Overview - Day 1\n10:05 - Day 2\n10:32 - Barbie: Fairytopia (2005)\n11:59 - Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus (2005)\n13:12 - Barbie Fairytopia: Mermaidia (2006)\n14:28 - The Barbie Diaries (2006)\n27:08 - Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses (2006)\n28:17 - Barbie Fairytopia: Magic of the Rainbow (2007)\n29:25 - Barbie as the Island Princess (2007)\n30:49 - Barbie Mariposa (2008)\n31:58 - Barbie and the Diamond Castle (2008)\n33:29 - Barbie in ‚ÄòA Christmas Carol‚Äô (2008)\n34:16 - Barbie Presents: Thumbelina (2009)\n35:05 - Barbie and the Three Musketeers (2009)\n36:42 - Lore Overview - Day 2\n38:06 - Day 3\n39:15 - Barbie in a Mermaid Tale (2010)\n39:58 - Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale (2010)\n41:20 - Barbie: A Fairy Secret (2011)\n42:19 - Barbie: Princess Charm School (2011)\n43:23 - Barbie: A Perfect Christmas (2011)\n44:23 - Barbie in a Mermaid Tale 2 (2012)\n45:13 - Barbie: The Princess & The Popstar (2012)\n59:09 - Barbie in The Pink Shoes (2013)\n1:00:02 - Barbie: Mariposa and the Fairy Princess (2013)\n1:01:13 - Barbie & Her Sister in a Pony Tale (2013)\n1:02:31 - I am struggling \n1:04:07 - Lore Overview - Day 3\n1:06:40 - Day 4\n1:07:07 - Barbie: The Pearl Princess (2013)\n1:08:14 - Barbie in The Secret Door (2014)\n1:09:19 - Barbie in Princess Power (2015)\n1:10:33 - Barbie in Rock ‚ÄòN Royals (2015)\n1:11:33 - Barbie & her Sisters in the Great Puppy Adventure (2015)\n1:12:51 - Barbie: Spy Squad (2016)\n1:13:51 - Barbie: Star Light Adventure (2016)\n1:15:07 - Barbie & Her Sisters in A Puppy Chase\n1:28:29 - Lore Overview - Day 4\n1:30:16 - Day 5\n1:30:37 - Barbie Video Game Hero (2017)\n1:31:52 - Barbie: Dolphin Magic (2017)\n1:32:32 - Barbie Princess Adventure (2021)\n1:33:47 - Barbie and Chelsea: The Lost Birthday (2021)\n1:34:34 - Barbie: Big City Big Dreams (2022)\n1:35:18 - Day 6\n1:35:37 - Barbie: Mermaid Power (2022)\n1:36:12 - Barbie: Epic Road Trip (2022)\n1:37:29 - Barbie: Skipper and the Big Babysitting Adventure (2023)\n1:38:20 - Final Lore Overview\n1:40:47 - Ted‚Äôs BCU Theory\n1:46:57 - Finale",

That, combined with the legitimately unbelievable amount of bugs and errors and crashes left me feeling so exhausted and numb that I ultimately decided it was worth sacrificing one 25th of a second's worth of timing here and there.
