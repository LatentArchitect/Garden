running on empty
i waited years in a past life
running out of rope and the waters high
i drowned for you and i didnt regret it
dont text me back in the afterlife
needed the time i didnt realise
i had it along, cant take my own advice
conflated filling the gaps for love

and its obvious
that im caved in and breaking up
but i know its good
i know its good
though its over now
in my dreams you call me back
but i hope you dont
i hope you dont

i hope youre gone and lost in better days
i been watching the time, how it erodes away
thinking bout how the last years feel like yesterdays
how did i lose grip on it?
honest
been falling through nightmares lightyears away
doing my best to keep those thoughts at bay
finding my highlights in the loudest places
and strangers faces 
getting caught up in the race of it

walking through the clearing crowd
if we took our chances
but we exchanged glances
call it in the moment
walking down the roads that i grew up on
falling out of habits
stopped bleeding for empathys sake

and its obvious
that im caved in and breaking up
but i know its good
i know its good
though its over now
in my dreams you call me back
but i hope you dont
i hope you dont

cos i dont need you to tell me

that its ok im going
im searching
for what i am now
ill find you if its urgent
or if im hurting
more than i am now
and well come back here some day
and laugh about it
memories that dont know
how it felt like i was burning
while you werent watching
took everything i loved
now nowhere feels like home
nowhere feels like home

been a long life
still got mad time
took a wrong right
on it last time
through the long night
made it out alright
told my brother hold tight
sometimes i can feel it
sometimes i still
sometimes i feel
some times",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSJGCroU_Yw,YouTube Liked video,"IFTTT, YouTube","February 18, 2024 at 09:01PM"

Along the way, we'll learn about how complicated origami can really get, and how it's been used for solving some of the most interesting engineering problems. Then, we'll light up our creations and enjoy their beauty!

Instructor: Charlyn Gonda
The beauty of origami and how it has been used to solve engineering problems has fascinated Charlyn for a long time. She also has an irresistible urge to put LEDs in everything. 
This combo has led her down a rabbit hole of lighting up origami sculptures, and Charlyn would love to share what she‚Äôs learned with you!

How to Use NotebookLM (Google's New AI Tool),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iWPjBwXy_Io/maxresdefault.jpg,"Google's NotebookLM is way more than notetaking, writing, or organizational tool. It's an AI collaborator, grounded in your data with your unique view of the world. 

In this tutorial, I'll give you a tour of the main functionalities, demonstrate concrete use cases such as making sense of meeting notes or writing an article, and cover the current limitations. 

Visit https://ift.tt/L8PHQhC to sign up for a free NotebookLM account using your Google login (You must be at least 18 years of age, based in the U.S., and Workspace users must have ‚ÄúExperimental apps enabled‚Äù by an administrator)

üìñ Watch my full Readwise tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlWomVta4DU 

TECHNICAL NOTES
[08:37]: NotebookLM isn‚Äôt actually ‚Äútrained‚Äù on your data. The model is pre-trained, and the software just shuttles your inputs into its context window temporarily so it can answer factually based on that information. Once you end your session, the information you entered is wiped from the model's memory so your data is secure.

[13:30]: NotebookLM can answer specific questions, but holistic questions (such as ""Give me an outline of the entire book, in order"") are harder, because the model can‚Äôt take in the entire document at once; it can only see the most relevant passages for a given query.

Groundislava - Pregaming The Rapture,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rr04dS9kmXc/sddefault.jpg,"Track 1 ""Pregaming The Rapture"" by Groundislava from the 'S/T' LP (2011).

Purchase: https://ift.tt/VjMaUPm

For Jasper Patterson AKA Groundislava, creativity combined with the video game, sci-fi sounds and general aesthetics of the 1980's have been instilled since day one. A young 20 year-old hailing from Venice, California, Jasper's father both animated and directed the classic ""Take On Me"" video by A-Ha and while Groundislava isn't exactly the next logical step from the Norwegian new wave group, Jasper takes that same creative freedom and emotion and injects it into a sound grounded in beats, video games, technology and self-proclaimed ""nerdy shit."" As part of the Wedidit Collective (helmed by his old schoolmate Henry Laufer, better known as Shlohmo), Groundislava is the next representative stepping into the light and exposing a group of youngsters each with their own nonchalantly expert takes on forms of beat and electronic music. 

While deeply infatuated with the styles of house music and minimal techno (check ""The Dig"" or ""Stealth River Mission""), on his debut self-titled LP, Groundislava takes old templates of 8 bit and chip-tune styles and turns them into worlds full of oozing, swirling melodies backed by driving drum beats, heavy bass drops and soaring vocal melodies in spots from vocalist Weary. Alongside the crop of up and coming worldwide electronic producers such as Shlohmo, Young Montana? and another former classmate Baths, Patterson is primed and ready to unleash his unique brand of woozy 8-bit composition. Whereas much music that utilizes the 8 bit sound tends to feel fully mechanized and soulless, GIL injects heartfelt harmonies and melodies that demand attention - ""Final Impasse"" and ""One For Her"" will surely make you stop in your tracks and listen up. Elsewhere, Wedidit cohorts Jon Wayne and Shlohmo stop by for the track ""Shlava,"" with Wayne delivering super on point and off the cuff raps on top of Jasper's laid-back video game beat vibes. Another early favorite is the sinister and downtempo ""Animal,"" featuring Weary's dark and twisted croons. 

After a well-received free EP giveaway in early '11, Groundislava's self-titled debut LP + 7"" is scheduled for release on 4/19 through the Friends of Friends Music label. Included with the 12 song long-player are remixes from Young Montana? and Clive Tanaka.

""Ted doesn't know about modern monarchies like the U.K.""

I'm aware of the fact that there are monarchies in the world today. What I was trying to figure out was if Mirabella was an ""absolute monarchy,"" as in the monarch is the sole legislative power in the nation. In the case of something like the United Kingdom, that is a constitutional monarchy where the monarch has very little, to almost zero power in the actual workings of the government. There are 7 countries in the world today with absolute monarchies, and one of them funnily enough is The Vatican. 

""I cannot believe that he rated _____ so low"" 

I would not take my actual numbered ratings too seriously, as they can seriously be crippled by both the moral and sidekick ratings - which, honestly, are totally ridiculous categories to judge the movies and half the time I gave a zero if they didn't have them. If you are a Barbie fanatic, and genuinely liked a movie that I rated low, I'd suggest taking my ""Barbie"" and ""Story"" ratings, and then make that number out of 10. That's probably a more ""real"" rating for the Barbie movie.

MECHANICAL GOD,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v35imYtQqCo/maxresdefault.jpg,"This song is a collaboration with @crow4277, who is a tragically underrated channel with only 20 subscribers. I highly recommend checking their music out if you have the time :)

If this song were in an RPG, we imagine it to play during an intense boss fight against humanity's failed attempt to steal the power of the divine through the creation of a synthetic, mechanical god :0

Let's Build a Medieval Village in Manor Lords to see if it lives up to the Hype! | Ep. 1,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CZiFcVTXSNo/maxresdefault.jpg,"Manor Lords is currently the #1 most wish-listed game on Steam and without a doubt my most anticipated game of 2024.  While the game is slated to be released into early access on April 26th,  I have been given a bit of early access to the early access.   

So in this video, I want to kick of a village build.  I'll give you some tips and tricks that I've picked up after playing all week, as well as provide you with my first impressions and let you know if the game lives up to the hype!

A huge thank you to the developer, Slavic Magic, and publisher, Hooded Horse, for giving me early access to the game.  Though I was provided a key, this is not a sponsored video.

Trigger warning for loud sounds towards the end of the vid.

This was entirely edited, and was supposed to be exported, in 48fps, not 50. Funny thing is, Premiere simply doesn't allow custom frame rates in its export window, despite supporting it as a sequence setting. I could have exported the Premiere  file into After Effects and added the sequence to the render cue, but I couldn't because AE threw me an error every time I tried. That, combined with the legitimately unbelievable amount of bugs and errors and crashes left me feeling so exhausted and numb that I ultimately decided it was worth sacrificing one 25th of a second's worth of timing here and there. If you catch any editing errors, that'd be why. Oh well!!

26 Aseprite Tips for Beginners,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZLRdsGwV_4c/maxresdefault.jpg,"I recently did a thread over on Twitter where I posted a bunch of small things I've picked up over the years.

Original thread here: https://twitter.com/Nootall_/status/1435600476666482689

Since people seemed to like it, I've combined them all into a single 8-minute video to put here, hope they help!

I elaborate a lot more on these techniques in the thread I linked above: when I use them, why I prefer them over others, etc. So, if there's some confusion surrounding a few of the clips, I'd recommend checking the original posts out.

Spell: The RPG is a complete, original tabletop roleplaying game using six-sided dice and letter tiles. Roll dice to complete tasks with Impulses ‚Äì stats that describe a character‚Äôs motivations and personality. Draw random letter tiles to spell out magic abilities and keep the best spells to use again and again. This system balances creativity and potential with fair and streamlined mechanics.

Twelve Hundred Words is a series of five tiny tabletop RPGs; each one is exactly two hundred words and then all the other words in this 12-page zine add up to exactly the titular value. These games represent, in the abstract, my experiences with having OCD and Anxiety.

Through the Stars is a storytelling science fiction tabletop RPG set in the Prime-Originate Galaxy. Gather your friends and assemble a crew to choose your place within a galaxy beset with interstellar conflict and powerful ancient forces. Build a crew of pirates, form a group of explorers, or fight in the galaxy‚Äôs shared efforts against its common enemies‚Äîtell the story you and your friends have always wanted to tell.

LYRICS

They named a place about the time inside my head
They called it heaven hell I felt like I was dead
I heard them saying that it's best to leave behind
But don't you worry we'll

Protect you while you find
A suitcase and a mind
Love inside the time
Doesn't matter why

Ahh ahh ahh

And if you listen well you may just understand
The secret language that is written in the sand
The winds will whisper till you think you have a plan
And if you hear it right

The words will set you free
Breath Or be breathed


Ahh ahh ahh


And if you leave
Just don't make me wait

working
Till the sun comes up
I've been bleeding
Bleeding out my love

I'll be here
circling my drain

working
Try to measure up
Sleeping
Sleeping off my love


I dont
say that I love you
As much as I used to

But it's true 
That I still love you
As much as I used to


Don't you know
I'll feel all your pain",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-omzTz2h9c,YouTube Liked video,"IFTTT, YouTube","May 11, 2024 at 02:01PM"
